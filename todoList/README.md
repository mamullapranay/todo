#Todo Application
Welcome to the Todo application repository! This project is a simple yet powerful task management tool built using React and Redux. It allows users to organize their tasks by adding, updating, deleting, and marking them as complete, with the added benefit of persisting tasks locally using browser local storage.

#Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
Redux Toolkit: The official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.
React-Redux: Official React bindings for Redux, enabling React components to interact with the Redux store.
LocalStorage: HTML5 feature used to store todos locally, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.
Features
Add Todo: Input a new task and click "Add Todo" to include it in your list.
Edit Todo: Modify a task's description by clicking the edit (üìÅ) button and saving your changes.
Delete Todo: Remove a task from the list by clicking the delete (‚ùå) button.
Persist Todos: Utilizes local storage to automatically save tasks, ensuring they are accessible even after refreshing the page.
#Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash

git clone 
cd todo-app
Install dependencies:


Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

src/
app/
store.js: Configures the Redux store using configureStore.
features/
todo/
todoSlice.js: Defines the Redux slice (todoSlice) for managing todos.
components/
AddTodo.js: Component for adding new todos.
Todos.js: Component for displaying the list of todos.
TodoItem.js: Component for individual todo items with edit and delete functionality.
App.js: Main component integrating AddTodo and Todos.
Redux Integration
Redux is utilized for state management in this application to streamline and manage the state of todos effectively. Key concepts and utilities include:

Redux Toolkit: Utilizes createSlice and configureStore for simplified Redux setup.
Actions and Reducers: Actions (addTodo, removeTodo, updateTodo) and reducers manage todo state changes.
Local Storage: Integrates with local storage for persistent todo data.
Usage
Adding a Todo
Enter a task description in the input field.
Click "Add Todo" to add it to your list.
Editing a Todo
Click the edit (üìÅ) button next to the task you want to modify.
Update the text in the input field.
Click "Save" to confirm the changes.
Deleting a Todo
Click the delete (‚ùå) button next to the task you wish to remove.
Persisting Todos
Tasks are automatically saved to local storage, ensuring they are retained even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging utility classes directly applied to elements for a clean and responsive user interface.

Conclusion
This Todo application demonstrates effective use of React with Redux for robust state management and local storage for seamless data persistence. It provides an intuitive user interface for efficiently managing tasks. For questions or feedback, feel free to contact us!
